   <h2> <span class="bgGreen">A Glimpse Through Time</span></h2> 

  <b> <span id="textcolor"> Lena found the pocket watch at a small, dusty antique shop in the heart of the city. It was tucked away in a corner, barely noticeable among other relics of the past. The watch was delicate, its brass casing worn smooth by time, with intricate engravings that shimmered faintly in the dim light. Something about it felt… alive.
    
    The shopkeeper, an elderly man with clouded eyes, watched her curiously as she picked it up. “That one’s special,” he said in a low voice. “Be careful what you wish to change.”
    
    Lena raised an eyebrow. “Change?” <br/>
    
    The man smiled but said nothing more, and she left the shop with the watch tucked in her pocket, her thoughts drifting back to memories she had long tried to forget.
    
    That night, as she sat on her bed, turning the watch over in her hands, it suddenly clicked open, revealing its face. The hands began to spin, faster and faster, until they stopped—midnight. A soft hum filled the room, and a whisper brushed against her ear: “One day. Choose wisely.”
    
    Her heart raced. She understood now. The watch could take her back to any day in her life. A chance to relive it, to alter a choice, to undo a mistake.
    
    Lena’s mind swirled with possibilities. Should she go back to the day her father had left, when she was only eight years old, and beg him to stay? Or maybe to the night of the accident, when she lost her best friend in a moment of careless distraction? Or could she go back to the time when she had let the love of her life walk away without telling him how she truly felt?
    
    With trembling hands, she closed her eyes and made her choice. <br/>
    
    The room dissolved around her, and when her eyes opened again, she stood in her childhood home. It was the morning her father left. The smell of pancakes wafted from the kitchen, and she heard her parents arguing in hushed voices, just like she remembered. Her younger self sat in the living room, pretending not to hear them, clutching her favorite stuffed bear.
    
    Lena, now a stranger in her own past, walked toward the kitchen. She knew this moment, the exact second her father would grab his coat and storm out the door. But this time, she would change it. She would stop him.
    
    Her father’s voice grew louder. The door creaked as it opened, and Lena’s heart pounded in her chest. She stepped forward, ready to speak—when she saw her mother’s face.
    
    Tears streamed down her mother’s cheeks. She wasn’t begging him to stay; she was telling him to leave. Her mother wasn’t the helpless woman Lena had imagined all these years. She had been strong, holding onto her dignity even as her world crumbled.
    
    Lena’s breath caught in her throat. If she stopped him, she would be undoing her mother’s courage, her choice. <br/>
    
    She stepped back, watching as her father left, just as he had before. But this time, Lena didn’t feel the same anger or confusion. Instead, she felt something new—a sense of understanding, of peace.
    
    As the watch hummed in her pocket, pulling her back to the present, Lena smiled. Some things weren’t meant to be changed. Some things were meant to be accepted.
